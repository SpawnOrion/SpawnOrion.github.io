<p>Okay, I'm not.  And I realize how amateur it is to use this particular design while I'm looking for work, but I like bright green on black.  Let's be honest, if you take things that seriously I'm probably not the guy for you.</p>

<p>I am currently working on a project utilizing Java and MySQL inspired by my latest job. I chose Java or two reasons: I have done more playing around with it than I have C++ or C#, and I don't want to admit to knowing VB; this project originally was targeted at an OS X environment while I wanted to develop from Windows and Linux.  I chose MySQL as it appeared from my research to be fairly stable, widely used (and thus more likely to have someone be able to support it after I left). The company, a mom and pop operation, was founded in 1992 and had only minimally implemented newer technology since then. This means that the collections department had to manually keep track of payments, different people were generating reports from scratch based off of the same numbers and all kinds of WTF. This project was a concept I had while I was there, but never really had enough time to fully implement. Probably definitely had nothing to do with the fact that I was so busy doing redundant work. Yeeaaahhhh.</p>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">using GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new <code>gh-pages</code> branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.</p>
