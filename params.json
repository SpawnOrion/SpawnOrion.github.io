  "body": "## Hi.\r\nThank you for visiting my personal site.  Right now it is only a single page, but over the coming weeks I plan on expanding it.  It will include more about me, a personal blog covering things from solutions I've discovered to tech problems, gaming and more, and a more detailed description of my work experience than can be found on my resume.\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\nI currently have three projects I am working on.  One is expanding this one page site out.  For now I am using the automatic page generator on GitHub, which does a pretty nifty job of letting you format the pages and selecting templates for layout.\r\n\r\nProject number two was inspired by my latest job.  It will utilize Java and MySQL. I chose Java or two reasons: I have done more playing around with it than I have C++ or C#, and I don't want to admit to knowing VB; this project originally was targeted at an OS X environment while I wanted to develop from Windows and Linux.  I chose MySQL as it appeared from my research to be fairly stable, widely used (and thus more likely to have someone be able to support it after I left).\r\n\r\nFinally, project number three is setting up two virtual machines, one a Windows Server 2008 and the other Windows Server 2012.  I'll use these to learn Active Directory and likely set up one of them to run SQL Server.\r\n\r\n### Work Experience\r\nI will soon be including my resume and work experience.\r\n\r\n### Finally...\r\nThank you for stopping by.  I hope you come back to visit again.\r\n",
