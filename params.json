Let's be honest, if you take things that seriously I'm probably not the guy for you.\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\nI am currently working on a project utilizing Java and MySQL inspired by my latest job. I chose Java or two reasons: I have done more playing around with it than I have C++ or C#, and I don't want to admit to knowing VB; this project originally was targeted at an OS X environment while I wanted to develop from Windows and Linux.  I chose MySQL as it appeared from my research to be fairly stable, widely used (and thus more likely to have someone be able to support it after I left). The company, a mom and pop operation, was founded in 1992 and had only minimally implemented newer technology since then. This means that the collections department had to manually keep track of payments, different people were generating reports from scratch based off of the same numbers and all kinds of WTF. This project was a concept I had while I was there, but never really had enough time to fully implement. Probably definitely had nothing to do with the fact that I was so busy doing redundant work. Yeeaaahhhh.\r\n\r\n### This page is under construction. The following will be left for my reference until I am satisfied with how the page is.\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
