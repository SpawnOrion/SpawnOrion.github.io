<a id="hi" class="anchor" href="#hi" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hi.</h2>

<p>Thank you for visiting my personal site.  Right now it is only a single page, but over the coming weeks I plan on expanding it.  It will include more about me, a personal blog covering things from solutions I've discovered to tech problems, gaming and more, and a more detailed description of my work experience than can be found on my resume.</p>

<h3>
<a id="projects" class="anchor" href="#projects" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Projects</h3>

<p>I currently have three projects I am working on.  One is expanding this one page site out.  For now I am using the automatic page generator on GitHub, which does a pretty nifty job of letting you format the pages and selecting templates for layout.</p>

<p>Project number two was inspired by my latest job.  It will utilize Java and MySQL. I chose Java or two reasons: I have done more playing around with it than I have C++ or C#, and I don't want to admit to knowing VB; this project originally was targeted at an OS X environment while I wanted to develop from Windows and Linux.  I chose MySQL as it appeared from my research to be fairly stable, widely used (and thus more likely to have someone be able to support it after I left).</p>

<p>Finally, project number three is setting up two virtual machines, one a Windows Server 2008 and the other Windows Server 2012.  I'll use these to learn Active Directory and likely set up one of them to run SQL Server.</p>

<h3>
<a id="work-experience" class="anchor" href="#work-experience" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Work Experience</h3>

<p>I will soon be including my resume and work experience.</p>

<h3>
<a id="finally" class="anchor" href="#finally" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Finally...</h3>

<p>Thank you for stopping by.  I hope you come back to visit again.</p>
